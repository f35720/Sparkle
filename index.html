<p>Sparkle puts a new shine on crypto currency by combining the properties of Bitcoin with the price stability of the dollar.  Sparkle brings with it the best of BitShares while retaining Proof of Work as a proven politic free consensus system.  Sparkle is a fully functional decentralized exchange with support for both user issued assets and fully collateralized BitAssets.  </p>

<a id="basic-stats" class="anchor" href="#basic-stats" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic Stats</h3>

<ul>
<li>SPK (Spark) is the base unit.</li>
<li>100 Million Initial Allocation to 33% BTS, 33% AGS, and 33% PTS holders.</li>
<li>20 second block times </li>
<li>50 SPK per block paid to miners (sha512) falling linearly over 100 years (similar to Bitcoin)</li>
<li>50 SPK per block divided among 101 workers elected by the sparklers (spark-holders). </li>
</ul>

<p>After one year there will be about 250 Million Sparks allocated with 60% allocated to the early adopters and supporters of Sparkle.</p>

<h3>
<a id="paid-workers" class="anchor" href="#paid-workers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Paid Workers</h3>

<p>Unlike most other crypto currency projects, Sparkle is able to bootstrap its own development and pay to build the critical infrastructure necessary to make it happen.  Development and marketing for Sparkle is paid for over time as 101 workers are allocated the same number of new Sparks as the Miners.   Each worker can campaign to get a paid position.  In the first year about 75 Million Sparks will be allocated among up to 101 individuals or about 750,000 Sparks each.   If Sparkle can reach the top 10 crypto currency with a $10 million market cap then Sparkle could pay 101 workers each $30,000 per year.   However, in such a situation the sparklers would probably decide to hire only 20 workers each earning $150,000 per year.   </p>
