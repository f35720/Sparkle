Sparkle 
------------------
Sparkle is the first next-generation block chain built around proof-of-work with all of the latest innovations provided by BitShares, including BitAssets and paid workers. 

General Info:

   The unit of account will be the “spark” (SPK)   
   1 billion initial sparks allocated 50/50 AGS/PTS as of November 5th.
   1 minute average block times.
   101 paid workers elected by the sparklers (aka spark-holders) 
   50 Spark Mining reward halving every 4 years
   50 Spark Worker reward halving every 4 years divided among all workers proportional to their pay rate.
   100% Transaction fees are paid to miners.

   Other than replacing the consensus algorithm with proof of work and tweaking the worker pay Sparkle will continue to evolve to incorporate all of the latest features being produced by the BitShares delegates.  

   It is our firm belief that BitShares is a great product but that it is hindered by using an unproven consensus system.  By adapting BitShares to Proof of Work we hope to bring BitAssets to the masses and gain wide acceptance among the huge proof of work user base.
